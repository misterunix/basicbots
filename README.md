# **BasicBots**ðŸ¤–

## **What is BasicBots?**
**BasicBots** is a game that gives you experience of a robo-fight two bots competiting with each other.

## **My Inspiration**
My first exposure to programming combat games was [Tom Poindexter's](https://github.com/tpoindex) original [crobots](http://tpoindex.github.io/crobots/) from 1985, for me which is still gives an experience to play. 

## **User Interface**
By not loosing the charm and feel of the game I have given it the original ASCII effect that creates an amazing view for the player.

## **Programming Language**
 **BasicBots** uses a subset of *BASIC*. Why *BASIC*? Well, to give an experience to the players of what its like to play on the 8 bit view a time machine taking back to the old world charm of the gamers.
It will once again give the wxperince of arcade gaming .

## **Build Instruction**

To build basicbots, simply call `make` - this will build Linux and Windows binaries. The OSX port has not been prepared yet.

## **My First Open Source Contribution**

I expect it will take time for me to learn the do's and dont's the key tips of managing an > Open Source project. 
the project is open for all the contributor to engage and make an impact of there own.

- Fixing spelling errors and typos.
- Creating documentation.
- Documenting the code.
- Squashing bugs.
- Adding features.
- Suggesting enhancements.
- Guiding me to a better understanding of Open Source projects.
